Quote:
" And Jesus said unto them, 
Can the children of the bridechamber fast, 
while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have 
the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. "
(Mark 2:19-20 KJV - King James Bible)

Jesus Questioned About Fasting

18 Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. 
Some people came and asked Jesus, “How is it that John’s disciples and 
the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not?”
19 Jesus answered, “How can the guests of the bridegroom fast 
while he is with them? They cannot, so long as they have 
him with them. 20 But the time will come when the bridegroom 
will be taken from them, and on that day they will fast.
21 “No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. 
Otherwise, the new piece will pull away from the old, 
making the tear worse. 22 And no one pours new wine into 
old wineskins. Otherwise, the wine will burst the skins, and 
both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined. No, 
they pour new wine into new wineskins.”
